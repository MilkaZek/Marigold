            motivational app created by four students (who you can learn more about in the "About" page!) as a final
            project in a coding camp called Kode With Klossy.</p>

          <p class="leftbox-text">Our team has noticed that like us many people have experienced lack of motivation
            while doing their daily tasks and assignments such as homework. Did you know that 50% of people have a
            problem with motivation, and even before the pandemic 47% of high schoolers reported not being able to
            concentrate while studying?</p>

          <p>Because of this we decided to create a way for students (and all of us with long to-do lists) to find
            ourselves in a better headspace to efficiently breeze through those lists. As academically inclined
            students, we've also compiled resources to help you get started on your journey toward organization and
            'working smarter, not harder.'</p>

            Our biggest feature is our mood selector! When you click on the "Mood" page you'll see a selection of moods
            and all you have to do before you start on your work is pick the one that most suits you in that moment.
          </p>

          <p class="get-started">
            Then you'll be redirected to a set of videos, resources, and tips to help you get through that work session,
            tailored to how you're feeling at that moment. </p>

          <p class="get-started">
            If you just need some general study/task resources, like a calendar, timer, or mini-exercise video, head
            over to the "Resources" page for quick access. :) </p>

          <p class="get-started">
            We hope this highlights the importance of acknowledging your feelings and what it truly means when one says
            'everyone's journey to efficiency is their own.'
