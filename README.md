# Marigold

## Welcome to Marigold!
- Are you a student with too much homework? An adult with a long to-do list? Is the only thing stopping your productivity the fact that you're not in the mood to do the work? Then check out Marigold!
- This site is meant to help people get motivated to tackle whatever tasks they need to take on no matter their starting mood.

### Mood Selector!
- You can click on the mood you most identify with at the moment and be redirected to a page with a color-scheme and music playlist that matches that mood
- The goal is to help people move into a productive mindset and boost their mood in the process, and there are productivity tips and Easter eggs throughout the site for users to explore

**Note**: This site was originally developed on Replit but now runs on GitHub; here is the link to use the site!

**Note**: This was a group project for a final project in a Kode With Klossy summer program! Thank you to my amazing fellow coders Joey, Nutsiko, & Rodalyn who you can learn more about on the "about" page of our site!
